# Hi, I'm Barry

Welcome to Hi, I'm Barry. Visit the site  
[here](https://bariryan.github.io/followalongPortfolio/) 

This is the oline gallery and shop for me, Barry Ryan. It provides a convenient way for potential clients to view my work while also allowing me to expand on my skills and services. 

I hope that this site can be a connection hub to meet both my clients interests and exhibite my work to a wider audience online.

# Features 

![hello](https://github.com/bariryan/followalongPortfolio/blob/master/assets/images/mastermockup.png)


## CSS Flexbox and Responsive Design

I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following -

 created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.

 
## Navigation Bar

  Featured on the home page, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page to allow for easy navigation.

  This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

 ## H1 Fontawesome and Google Fonts

Also the use of icons on the main page attempt to consolidate all affilate social media links into a consise visual representation which is easy to recognise and navigate.

 ## Contact form Sign up 

 This page will allow the user to get signed up to Hi, I'm Barry to start their communication with the Artist. The user will be able specify if they would like to commission new work or buy exsisting work. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address with the option of leaving a comment if nessecceary. 

 # User expectations
 * as a user, I want to purchase work directly from the Artist.
 * as a user, I want to commission original projects with the Artist.  

 ## Testing 

This website has been designed and implemented with all modern devices and screen resolutions in mind. Therefore a fully responsive layout for all devices has been a crucial concern for the website Hi, I'm Barry.


You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
