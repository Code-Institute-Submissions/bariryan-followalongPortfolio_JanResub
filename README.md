# Hi, I'm Barry

Welcome to Hi, I'm Barry. This is the oline gallery and shop for me, Barry Ryan. It provides a convenient way for potential clients to view my work while also allowing me to expand on my skills and services. 

I hope that this site can be a connection


# followalongPortfolio
I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following -

# H1 CSS Grid & Flexbox
 created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.

 # H1 Fontawesome and Google Fonts
